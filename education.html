      <p>I went to three elementary schools.
      I did kindergarden, first and second grade in Blackham Elementary, Then I spent 3rd grade in Roosevelt to finally transfer to 4th grade Achievement First Academy! </p>
      <p> Little did I know that in the Achievement first network, I would stay until the end of my high school career. I went on to my middle school years with Achievement first middle.I was accepted to enter Amistad High School for my 9-12th grade. </p>
      <p> I'm proud to say I'm a future Camel for class of 2029 at Connecticut College!!</p>
