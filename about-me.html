    <h1> About Cindy! </h1>
    <h2> Family </h2>
    <div class="family">
      <p> I take pride in being Ecuadorian.I am an only child with loving parents. I have a cat named Kiba (Hebrew based) which means protector. I live with my mom and my aunts in the same house. We are close with each other spending quality time. </p>
    </div>
      <h2> Languages </h2>
    <div class="family">
      <p> My first lanuage is English. Although I lived in a spanish household, I learned English first because my mom wanted me to learn to speak spanish after. I was able to quickly pick up spanish after several years of hearing my mom talk to our relatives. During my sophmore and junior year, I took two years of french. I have always been interested in french and learning about the expressions.</p>

    <h2> Dreams </h2>
    <div class="family">
      <p> I have always wanted to go to Europe and learn about the cultures. I also wanted to always write poems and be able to present them. Lastly, I have always wanted to sing.
       I am proud to say that I am a published poet. One of my poems being put into ' The Power of Words'. This was a partnership with Fairfield University for young writers. I am also proud because I am a singer for my local church and serving as an entertainment for my community service hours. </p>

    <div class="family">
    <p>Hopefully in the future I'll be able to travel around Europe. Achieving this would complete my bucket list for the rest of my life. Who knows? Maybe I'll move over there! I want to also be in Musical Theatre.</p>
